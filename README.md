## Overview

This program aims to improve the sorting speed of the merge-sort sorting algorithm. However, it does not focus on optimising time and space complexity, but instead increases computational speed through multi-threaded optimisation.

Single-threaded merge-sort, also known as, serial merge-sort, utilises only one thread on one CPU core to sort array of length *n*. When implementing parallel merge-sort, multiple threads become available. At the discretion of the OS multi-process scheduler, the numerous threads can be spread across multiple CPU cores to increase performance, with each core only required to sort an array of size *n/N*, where N is the number of threads running concurrently.

## Manifest

A listing of source files and other non-generated files, and a brief
(one-line) explanation of the purpose of each file.


## Building the project

This section should tell the user how to build your code.  If you are
delivering a library, where does it need to be installed, or how do you use
it? Is this an executable, if so, how can a user get up to speed as fast as
possible?

## Features and usage

Summarise the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to
instruct the user how to use your program.

## Testing

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating "I ran
it a few times and it seems to work" is not sufficient. Your testing needs
to be detailed here.

## Known Bugs

List known bugs that you weren't able to fix (or ran out of time to fix).

## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your own?
What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

## Sources Used

If you used any sources outside of the textbook, you should list them here. 
If you looked something up on stackoverflow.com or you use help from AI, and 
fail to cite it in this section, it will be considered plagiarism and dealt 
with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
